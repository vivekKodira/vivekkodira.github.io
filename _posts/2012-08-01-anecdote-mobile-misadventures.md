Was conducting interviews when I realized I'd misplaced my phone. Told the HR rep. He said he'd call my number and we could try to hear it ring if it was close by. The phone rang and someone answered. He asks: "Hello, who are you? Where did you find this phone? Its yours? Where are you? Mysore?" - at this point I suddenly realized that I'd given him my father's number. 

Decided to call up my father from my desk phone. The call rang and at the same time, my mobile rang too. I answered the mobile and at the same time my call also was answered. (you know by now where this is going... :)). Told the person on the land-line, "one minute" and answered the mobile. Realized what I'd done after two minutes of "hello"ing.
