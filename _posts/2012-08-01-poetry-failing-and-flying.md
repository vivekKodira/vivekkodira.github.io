Everyone forgets that Icarus also flew.

It's the same when love comes to an end,<br/>
or the marriage fails and people say <br/>
they knew it was a mistake, that everybody <br/>
said it would never work. That she was<br/>
old enough to know better. But anything <br/>
worth doing is worth doing badly.<br/>

Like being there by that summer ocean <br/>
on the other side of the island while <br/>
love was fading out of her, the stars <br/>
burning so extravagantly those nights that <br/>
anyone could tell you they would never last.<br/>

Every morning she was asleep in my bed<br/>
like a visitation, the gentleness in her <br/>
like antelope standing in the dawn mist.<br/>

Each afternoon I watched her coming back <br/>
through the hot stony field after swimming, <br/>
the sea light behind her and the huge sky <br/>
on the other side of that. Listened to her <br/>
while we ate lunch.<br/>

How can they say <br/>
the marriage failed? Like the people who <br/>
came back from Provence (when it was Provence) <br/>
and said it was pretty but the food was greasy.<br/>

I believe Icarus was not failing as he fell, <br/>
but just coming to the end of his triumph.<br/>
