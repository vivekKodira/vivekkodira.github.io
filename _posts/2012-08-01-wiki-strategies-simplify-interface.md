One of the most difficult aspects of managing a wiki is getting your team to contribute. While there are several ways to motivate users to contribute, the easiest is to make the interface easy.

One feature of a wiki that can help ease input are the Topic Templates. In our wiki, we used Templates and HTML forms to create a simple text-box and button interfaces to creating Minutes of Meetings, Presentations, API documentation and FAQs. Creating an FAQ was so simple that it soon became the most popular section of the wiki. 

Templates have another advantage, they help you ensure that the content that is added follows a standard and this ensures the content is search-able.
