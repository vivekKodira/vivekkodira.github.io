I don't usually read books that have been hyped. Have no good reason for this odd(?) behaviour. However a friend forced this one on me over the weekend. Not wanting to disappoint, I read the book and was pleasantly surprised. The story is that of an autistic boy who discovers a dead dog in a neighbour's garden. Told from his point of view, it details his 'investigations' for a couple of days and then later goes on to much more serious topics. There was a delicacy and a thoroughness in the narrative that I enjoyed and the story was captivating too. Recommend it for a rainy day - be warned though: may have you reaching for tissues if you are sensitive.
