Picked up 'India after Gandhi' after seeing a copy with Lahar and I enjoyed the book thoroughly. Its a well researched and (more importantly) well written book. The book is big both in scope and size and lived up to the expectations I had of it. I especially liked the fact that the author was able to see India objectively (or at least as objectively as I see it) warts and all and still not be cynical. The only criticism I have is that economic growth hasn't been given the importance one would expect but perhaps that was intentional. The book is big enough trying to cover everything from personalities to culture. Recommend it highly.
