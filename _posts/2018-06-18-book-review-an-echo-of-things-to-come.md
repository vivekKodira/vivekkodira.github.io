I enjoyed this book more than I did the first one. The story and characters were familiar so the jumps back and forth in time made more sense. 

The dialogues still are the best part for me. Both people debating for opposite causes think what they are doing is for the right cause. And find ways to justify their actions.

Despite what seemed like a slow start, a lot happens in the book. And even knowing what is to come - there are quite a few surprises. Time travel is one of the most difficult things to put into a story. This series handles it better than most. 

Looking forward to the next book
