Written by George R R Martin, this series has many things that set it apart from the other books of this genre (Fantasy).

The first is that the story is told from several characters' points of view. Each chapter's title indicates whose story is being told. 

The second is that the characters all have grey shades. Because most events are seen from several different angles - they become justifiable. It becomes difficult to say who is good and who is 'bad'. 

The third is that this is an 'adult' book. Most of the books I've read of this genre tend to gloss over the day-to-day lives of their characters. The protagonists are always & only doing great things or having adventures. This book tends to the opposite. 

Am on the 4th and the last (published) book now. There are three more to go in the series. Enjoying it thoroughly. Is one of the best series I've read. Recommend it highly.

Update on 9-Sep-2011: After reading the 5th installment, I've decided to not recommend this series to anyone. The 'adult' aspects were taken a little too far in this one. But what was most irritating was that it didn't go anywhere - was a huge disappointment after waiting so long.
