Enjoyed a talk by [John Wooden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wooden) immensely. The mp3, video and transcript are available [here](http://www.ted.com/talks/john_wooden_on_the_difference_between_winning_and_success.html).

There were some very good poetry quoted in the speech. Here they are:


## At God's footstool

At God's footstool, to confess,<br/>
A poor soul knelt and bowed his head.<br/>
"I failed," he cried. The master said,<br/>
"Thou didst thy best. That is success."



## No written word, no spoken plea
No written word, no spoken plea<br/>
Can teach our youth what they should be;<br/>
Nor all the books on all the shelves<br/>
It's what the teachers are themselves.


## They ask me why I teach
They ask me why I teach <br/>
and I reply, Where could I find such splendid company? <br/>
There sits a statesman, strong, unbiased, wise. <br/>
Another Daniel Webster, silver-tongued. <br/>
A doctor sits beside him, whose quick steady hand <br/>
may mend a bone, or stem the life blood's flow. <br/>
And there a builder. Upward rise the arch of a church he builds, <br/>
wherein that minister may speak the word of God<br/>
and lead a stumbling soul to touch the Christ.<br/>
And all about a gathering of teachers, farmers, merchants, laborers. <br/>
Those who work and vote and build and plan and pray into a great tomorrow. <br/>
And I may say, I may not see the church, or hear the word <br/>
or eat the food their hands may grow. <br/>
But yet again I may. <br/>
And later I may say, I knew him once, <br/>
and he was weak, or strong,or bold or proud or gay. <br/>
I knew him once, but then he was a boy. <br/>
They ask me why I teach <br/>
and I reply, 'Where could I find such splendid company?'"<br/>



## The Road Ahead, or The Road Behind

Sometimes I think the Fates must grin <br/>
as we denounce them and insist <br/>
the only reason we can't win, <br/>
is the Fates themselves that miss. <br/>
Yet there lives on the ancient claim:<br/>
we win or lose within ourselves. <br/>
The shining trophies on our shelves<br/>
can never win tomorrow's game.<br/>
You and I know deeper down, <br/>
there's always a chance to win the crown.<br/>
But when we fail to give our best, <br/>
we simply haven't met the test, <br/>
of giving all and saving none <br/>
until the game is really won. <br/>
Of showing what is meant by grit. <br/>
Of playing through when others quit. <br/>
Of playing through, not letting up. <br/>
It's bearing down that wins the cup. <br/>
Of dreaming there's a goal ahead. <br/>
Of hoping when our dreams are dead.<br/>
Of praying when our hopes have fled. <br/>
Yet losing, not afraid to fall, <br/>
if bravely we have given all. <br/>
For who can ask more of a man <br/>
than giving all within his span. <br/>
Giving all, it seems to me,<br/>
is not so far from victory. <br/>
And so the fates are seldom wrong, <br/>
no matter how they twist and wind. <br/>
It's you and I who make our fates <br/>
we open up or close the gates <br/>
on the road ahead or the road behind.<br/>
