Read this over the weekend. The first book ended on a cliffhanger and I couldn't wait. 

This one was also very well written and thoroughly enjoyable. There is not as much time spent on backstories in this one.

One of the blurbs about the series compared it to "Ocean's Eleven" and they weren't very inaccurate. There is a lot of back-and-forth. Even found one reference to the movie "Big Trouble in Little China". 

Given the premise setup in the first book, it should have been hard to top the suspense with nothing more to do than rescue a team member from a merchant but it does manage it. And does it well. 

Particularly loved the ending. Highly recommend the book and series.
