Do not stand at my grave and weep; <br/>
I am not there, I do not sleep. <br/>
I am a thousand winds that blow. <br/>
I am the softly falling snow. <br/>
I am the gentle showers of rain. <br/>
I am the fields of ripening grain. <br/>
I am the morning hush. <br/>
I am the graceful rush <br/>
of beautiful birds in circling flig<br/>ht. 
I am the star shine of the night. <br/>
I am the flowers that bloom. <br/>
I am in a quiet room. <br/>
I am the birds that sing. <br/>
I am in each lovely thing. <br/>
Do not stand at my grave and cry; <br/>
I am not there. I did not die.<br/>
