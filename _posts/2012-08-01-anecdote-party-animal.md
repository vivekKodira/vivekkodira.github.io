My wife's mother is an excellent cook. She invites us for dinner often and we are usually sent home with enough food to last us a couple of days. The other night, after such a dinner, as we were saying our good-byes, I noticed the brother-in-law holding a large container. 

I asked to carry it and he smiled and said "No, its OK". I asked again and again he refused. When I continued to insist, he politely pointed out that this was for the dog outside.

The next part will only make sense to folks who understand Tamil.

I told this anecdote to my colleage and friend Ponvel. He asked 'Did he say "Ide _anda_ nayi-ke"?'
