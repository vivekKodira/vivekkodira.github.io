As the number of topics on the wiki grow, they can quickly become unreachable.  Using a common header and embedding into every topic by default will help avoid this. 

To do this:
*  Create pages that will serve as common Headers and Footers.
*  Include the common header and footer in all your pages by editing the templates you use to create *  topics.
*  Use a plugin or put an inbuilt search that displays the topic's children into this common header/footer.
*  Later, we also added search boxes and added AJAX driven results which would suggest matches to users as they typed
