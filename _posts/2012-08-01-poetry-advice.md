"Advice"

I MUST do as you do? Your way I own<br/>
Is a very good way, and still, <br/>
There are sometimes two straight roads to a <br/>town,<br/>
One over, one under the hill. <br/>


You are treading the safe and the well-worn way,<br/>
That the prudent choose each time; <br/>
And you think me reckless and rash to-day<br/>
Because I prefer to climb.<br/>

Your path is the right one, and so is mine.<br/>
We are not like peas in a pod, <br/>
Compelled to lie in a certain line,<br/>
Or else be scattered abroad.<br/>

'T were a dull old world, methinks, my friend,<br/>
If we all just went one way; <br/>
Yet our paths will meet no doubt at the end,<br/>
Though they lead apart today.<br/>

You like the shade, and I like the sun;<br/>
You like an even pace, <br/>
I like to mix with the crowd and run,<br/>
And then rest after the race.<br/>

I like danger, and storm, and strife,<br/>
You like a peaceful time; <br/>
I like the passion and surge of life,<br/>
You like its gentle rhyme.<br/>

You like buttercups, dewy sweet,<br/>
And crocuses, framed in snow; <br/>
I like roses, born of the heat,<br/>
And the red carnation's glow.<br/>

I must live my life, not yours, my friend,<br/>
For so it was written down; <br/>
We must follow our given paths to the end,<br/>
But I trust we shall meet--in town.<br/>
