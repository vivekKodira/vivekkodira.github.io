Series review. Books 1 through 7

If you enjoy Fantasy + humor + a protagonist who does not take himself too seriously + romance + a leisurely pace + references to Shakespeare and Whitman + a strong female character who kicks ass and makes mistakes + references to every pantheon there is + good writing then there is a good chance you will enjoy this series. Highly recommended.
