Some of the most imaginative writing I've read in this genre. 

The author melds humor into every other page. The humor is mostly situational - not so much wordplay. But it works very well. I also liked the wierd similes used throughout the book. These are the phrases you skim in other books. In this one, you stop and go "Huh". 

I thought all the characters in the story were interesting. Though Slow-hand, as intended by the author, was my favourite. Matrick and Ganelon came a close second. What I liked best about the depictions was there was so much show and so little tell. 

Highly recommended.
