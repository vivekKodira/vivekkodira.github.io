Am not much of a sci-fi fan but read it anyway 'cause it (Snow Crash) was recommended by L. 

It is a very interesting and well-researched book. Won't bore you with the details (there are enough reviews and even a wiki article on the book)...will only say that it is to this decade what the book 1984 was to the one it was written in - ahead of its time. In fact, some of the stuff he mentions in the book (ex: religion being a disease that spreads) is also a theme in Richard Dawkin's 'The God Delusion'. 

A good book.
