The time I've lost in wooing,<br/>
In watching and pursuing<br/>
The light, that lies<br/>
In woman's eyes,<br/>
Has been my heart's undoing.<br/>
Though Wisdom oft has sought me,<br/>
I scorn'd the lore she brought me,<br/>
My only books<br/>
Were woman's looks,<br/>
And folly's all they've taught me.<br/>

- Thomas Moore.
