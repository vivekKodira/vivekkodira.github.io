I liked this book better than the first. Rather than Asho, I found myself rooting for Audsley. Weyland finally does something other than what you expect "knightly" characters in books to do. 
(view spoiler)

Though the story didn't progress much - I didn't mind. The writing felt crisper, the characters were less angsty. There was still too much explaining of feelings for the benefit of the reader. 

The magic system is revealed in greater detail. And more of the murky history of the world is understood. There is one chapter devoted to politics and it was well done: particularly enjoyed Tiron and Iskara's perspectives of the same event and her explaining the underlying political currents to Tiron. 

Looking forward to the next books. Recommended.
