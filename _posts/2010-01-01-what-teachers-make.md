I want to teach one day and so one of the things I google for are articles about teaching. 

One of the most entertaining speeches I've heard had to do with teaching - specifically about [creativity and whether schools these days are killing it](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html). It was a speech by [Sir Ken Robinson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Ken_Robinson) at TED.

Reddit is another good source of information. Yesterday, I discovered [this video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5629273206953884671&hl=en). It is titled 'Teaching Teaching and understanding Understanding'. 19 minutes long, it explains the different attitudes that students and teachers bring to the classroom and what makes a 'good' teacher. 

Google Video, explored further, brought me to what this post's title refers to. The author, [Taylor Mali](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Mali) is a teacher who participates in [poetry slams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry_slam). This poem is best heard in its [original rendering](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxsOVK4syxU) (youtube). 

## What Teachers Make 

He says the problem with teachers is, "What's a kid going to learn <br/>
from someone who decided his best option in life was to become a teacher?" <br/>
He reminds the other dinner guests that it's true what they say about <br/>
teachers: <br/>
Those who can, do; those who can't, teach.<br/>

I decide to bite my tongue instead of his <br/>
and resist the temptation to remind the other dinner guests <br/>
that it's also true what they say about lawyers.<br/>

Because we're eating, after all, and this is polite company.<br/>
"I mean, you're a teacher, Taylor," he says. <br/>
"Be honest. What do you make?"<br/>

And I wish he hadn't done that <br/>
(asked me to be honest) <br/>
because, you see, I have a policy <br/>
about honesty and a$-kicking: <br/>
if you ask for it, I have to let you have it.<br/>

You want to know what I make?<br/>

I make kids work harder than they ever thought they could. <br/>
I can make a C+ feel like a Congressional medal of honor <br/>
and an A- feel like a slap in the face. <br/>
How dare you waste my time with anything less than your very best.<br/>

I make kids sit through 40 minutes of study hall <br/>
in absolute silence. No, you may not work in groups. <br/>
No, you may not ask a question. <br/>
Why won't I let you get a drink of water? <br/>
Because you're not thirsty, you're bored, that's why.<br/>

I make parents tremble in fear when I call home: <br/>
I hope I haven't called at a bad time, <br/>
I just wanted to talk to you about something Billy said today. <br/>
Billy said, "Leave the kid alone. I still cry sometimes, don't you?" <br/>
And it was the noblest act of courage I have ever seen.<br/>

I make parents see their children for who they are <br/>
and what they can be.<br/>

You want to know what I make?<br/>

I make kids wonder, <br/>
I make them question. <br/>
I make them criticize. <br/>
I make them apologize and mean it. <br/>
I make them write, write, write. <br/>
And then I make them read. <br/>
I make them spell definitely beautiful, definitely beautiful, definitely <br/>
beautiful <br/>
over and over and over again until they will never misspell <br/>
either one of those words again. <br/>
I make them show all their work in math. <br/>
And hide it on their final drafts in English. <br/>
I make them understand that if you got this (brains) <br/>
then you follow this (heart) and if someone ever tries to judge you <br/>
by what you make, you give them this (the finger).<br/>

Let me break it down for you, so you know what I say is true: <br/>
I make a goddamn difference! What about you?<br/>
