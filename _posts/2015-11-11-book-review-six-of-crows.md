I enjoyed the book. The characters were very well fleshed out. Each one was interesting and their backstories were merged into the story very well. These days I also find that it is harder to read books which have not been edited well. So it was a pleasure to read one that was well written.

At times the book (and indeed the series) seems episodic: like the author was writing for a television audience. "Kaz opened the doors of a prison and walks in." ...and the perspective switches to another character who sees Kaz returning from his mysterious mission. This is a style I've not seen in the books I've read till now. 

I, the reader, always feel like I know more than the others in the story, not less. It was an interesting experience. 

Recommend highly.
