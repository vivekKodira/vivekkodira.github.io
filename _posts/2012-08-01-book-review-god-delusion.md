'The God Delusion' is a great book. One I think everyone should read. It is a book by an atheist (Richard Dawkins) that questions the concept of God. More importantly, it discusses how dangerous religion and 'faith' really are. There are answers to every argument that theists have put forward to 'prove' the existence of God and they are all hard hitting. The book should be read even if you are a believer - at least so you can understand that non-belief doesn't necessarily make a person evil. The content is good enough to merit the book a reading but as an added bonus - it is clever and funny. Recommend it highly
