It is easy enough to be pleasant,<br/>
When life flows by like a song,<br/>
But the man worth while is one who will smile,<br/>
When everything goes dead wrong.<br/>
For the test of the heart is trouble,<br/>
And it always comes with the years,<br/>
And the smile that is worth the praises of earth<br/>
Is the smile that shines through tears.<br/>

It is easy enough to be prudent,<br/>
When nothing tempts you to stray,<br/>
When without or within no voice of sin<br/>
Is luring your soul away;<br/>
But it's only a negative virtue<br/>
Until it is tried by fire,<br/>
And the life that is worth the honor of earth<br/>
Is the one that resists desire.<br/>

By the cynic, the sad, the fallen,<br/>
Who had no strength for the strife,<br/>
The world's highway is cumbered to-day;<br/>
They make up the sum of life.<br/>
But the virtue that conquers passion,<br/>
And the sorrow that hides in a smile,<br/>
It is these that are worth the homage on earth<br/>
For we find them but once in a while.<br/>
