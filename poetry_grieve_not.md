Grieve not
Do not stand at my grave and weep; 
I am not there, I do not sleep. 
I am a thousand winds that blow. 
I am the softly falling snow. 
I am the gentle showers of rain. 
I am the fields of ripening grain. 
I am the morning hush. 
I am the graceful rush 
of beautiful birds in circling flight. 
I am the star shine of the night. 
I am the flowers that bloom. 
I am in a quiet room. 
I am the birds that sing. 
I am in each lovely thing. 
Do not stand at my grave and cry; 
I am not there. I did not die.
