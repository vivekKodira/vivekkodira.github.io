<p>My first attempts at writing to an audience were on a company intranet Bulletin Board. When I first joined, the company was small (by today's standards) and there were a few witty and articulate people very active on its Bulletin Boards. I joined in enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Over time, my friends either quit the company, moved to other countries or just grew out of the phase where they enjoyed the Bulletin Board and its conversations. In time, because of work and other interests, I too quit using it. Many of the friends I made then still remain in touch and are active on the blogs I follow..</p>

<p>I then started blogging on the intranet - mostly as a way of archiving my favorite quotes, poems and links. Over the years, I have also had the opportunity to work with some very intelligent and wise people.I used blogs as a medium to share the lessons I was learning from them, in my day-to-day work, building the wiki or as I moved to new roles..</p>

<p>So, here in their new home, the posts below will be about some of the same things. You can expect to find strategies for wikis, mentoring, book reviews, (my favorite) poems, speeches, websites, personal anecdotes, jokes, attempts at humor and philosophy. Hope you enjoy them..</p>
