"Advice"

I MUST do as you do? Your way I own
Is a very good way, and still, 
There are sometimes two straight roads to a town,
One over, one under the hill. 


You are treading the safe and the well-worn way,
That the prudent choose each time; 
And you think me reckless and rash to-day
Because I prefer to climb.

Your path is the right one, and so is mine.
We are not like peas in a pod, 
Compelled to lie in a certain line,
Or else be scattered abroad.

'T were a dull old world, methinks, my friend,
If we all just went one way; 
Yet our paths will meet no doubt at the end,
Though they lead apart today.

You like the shade, and I like the sun;
You like an even pace, 
I like to mix with the crowd and run,
And then rest after the race.

I like danger, and storm, and strife,
You like a peaceful time; 
I like the passion and surge of life,
You like its gentle rhyme.

You like buttercups, dewy sweet,
And crocuses, framed in snow; 
I like roses, born of the heat,
And the red carnation's glow.

I must live my life, not yours, my friend,
For so it was written down; 
We must follow our given paths to the end,
But I trust we shall meet--in town.
